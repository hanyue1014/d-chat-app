# Decentralised Chat App
---
## This is created with the help of [Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqeTj_QAnNlmt7FwzNwHZnA) by his amazing Metaverse React Challenge

## What does this do
For now this app doesn't really serve any purpose except letting me to learn about Web 3.0, Nextjs, tailwindCss AND harness my reactjs skills

## Actual functionality
- Sign in with metamask wallet
- Chat on the testnet network (I assume)

## Technology used
- Nextjs
- Reactjs
- TailwindCss (can't say I'd prefer it over normal CSS though)
- Moralis

## Colors
Since everything is kinda on the spot, I will be attempting to use colors on the spot also.

PS: This is actually my first time touching Nextjs, Moralis and TailwindCss
